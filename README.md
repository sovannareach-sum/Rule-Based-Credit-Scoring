# Rule-Based Credit Scoring

## Project Description
This project implements a deterministic credit classification engine using Python to automate the assessment of loan applicant risk.

## Technical Implementation
* **Data Pipeline:** Developed an automated workflow using Pandas to ingest, clean, and validate a dataset of 1,000+ financial records.
* **Feature Logic:** Engineered a multi-conditional scoring function that evaluates key financial heuristics, including income thresholds, education levels, and homeownership status.
* **Data Preprocessing:** Handled categorical encoding and data integrity checks to ensure consistent classification across diverse applicant profiles.
* **Risk Categorization:** Efficiently mapped complex applicant data into three distinct risk tiers: High, Medium, and Low.

## Key Objectives
The primary goal of this implementation was to demonstrate how Management Information Systems (MIS) principles can be applied to bridge the gap between static banking policies and automated software solutions. By prioritizing interpretability, the model provides a reliable baseline for credit risk management where clear justification for loan approval or denial is required.
