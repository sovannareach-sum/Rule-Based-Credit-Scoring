    "1.Advantages of Rule-Based Machine Learning in Credit Assessment:\n",
    "\n",
    "Simplicity and Interpretability\n",
    "Rule-based models are easy to understand and interpret. Each decision is made through clear \"if-then\" rules, making it transparent for both developers and non-technical stakeholders, such as financial managers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quick Implementation\n",
    "It does not require complex algorithms or heavy computational resources. Rule-based models can be implemented quickly, especially for small to medium-sized datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Human Expertise Integration\n",
    "These models can directly incorporate human knowledge and domain expertise into the decision-making process, which is particularly useful in credit assessment where experts often have specific guidelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Limitations of Rule-Based Machine Learning in Credit Assessment:\n",
    "\n",
    "Lack of Flexibility\n",
    "Rule-based models are static and cannot automatically learn patterns from new data. Every update or improvement requires manual modification of rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scalability Issues\n",
    "As the complexity of the problem increases, the number of rules can become very large, making the system hard to maintain and prone to errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Poor Generalization\n",
    "Rule-based models may not perform well on unseen or unusual data, as they rely strictly on predefined conditions and cannot adapt to complex relationships hidden in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Subjectivity and Bias\n",
    "Since rules are manually designed, they may unintentionally reflect biases from the rule designer, which could lead to unfair credit assessments."
